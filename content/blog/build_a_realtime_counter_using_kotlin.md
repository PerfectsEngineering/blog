It is important to show realtime updates of what is happening in an application, and one form of this is a realtime counter. A realtime counter can be used to show users of an app how other users are interacting with their content. For example, Instagram uses a realtime counter to show when viewers like a live video. This makes users of the application feel more engaged as they will be getting immediate feedback when things change.

In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use Pusher to create a realtime counter in Kotlin.
