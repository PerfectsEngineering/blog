It is important to show realtime updates of what is happening in an application, and one form of this is a realtime counter. A realtime counter can be used to show users of an app how other users are interacting with their content. For example, Instagram uses a realtime counter to show when viewers like a live video. This makes users of the application feel more engaged as they will be getting immediate feedback when things change.

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll show you how to use Pusher to create a realtime counter in Kotlin.
