T﻿his post will focus on my observations with Kubernetes, but the general concept should apply to all other Container running platforms.

I﻿f you've ever worked with any software delivery process or pipeline, you will be familiar with Containerization.

Y﻿ou can specify CPU utilization units in fractions of a single CPU. Kubernetes limits the minimum value to \`1m\`, which is about \`0.0001\` of a whole vCPU.

I﻿'ve recently been on working on building

I can only use the CPU for 0.01 seconds every 0.1 seconds.

That’s also abbreviated as “100m”.
